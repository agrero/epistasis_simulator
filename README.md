# epistasis_simulator

Currently working on
-----------------------------
- Methods for plotting epistasis
  -Within the sire class
- Figure out a better name than epistasiscomponents

        #concat the mutations some other way
        #the method i'm thinking of now is makin a list of mutations, if the mutations are already in the list remove
        #may need some way to have a list of sequence indices as to make sure that the the same index isn't mutated
        #do that instead of checking if the mutation is the same
        #maybe finish this off with a tree diagram in addition to the violin plot
